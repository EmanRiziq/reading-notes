### What is a Graph?
A Graph is a non-linear data structure consisting of nodes and edges. The nodes are sometimes also referred to as vertices and the edges are lines or arcs that connect any two nodes in the graph. More formally a Graph can be defined as, A Graph consisting of a finite set of vertices(or nodes) and a set of edges that connect a pair of nodes.

### Types of Graphs:
1.  Finite Graphs.
2.  Infinite Graph. 
3.  Trivial Graph.
4.  Simple Graph.
5.  Multi Graph.
6.  Null Graph.
7.  Complete Graph.
8.  Pseudo Graph.
9.  Regular Graph.
10.  Bipartite Graph.
11.  Labeled Graph.
12.  Digraph Graph.
13.  Subgraph.
14.  Cyclic Graph.

### Basic Properties of a Graph
1. **Distance between two Vertices:** It is basically the number of edges that are available in the shortest path between vertex A and vertex B.
2. **The eccentricity of a Vertex:** Maximum distance from a vertex to all other vertices.
3. **Radius of a Connected Graph:** The minimum value of eccentricity from all vertices.
4. **Diameter of A Connected Graph:** The vertex having maximum eccentricity
5. **Central Point and Centre:** The vertex having minimum eccentricity
