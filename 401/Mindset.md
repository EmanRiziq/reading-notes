# What is deliberate practice ?
Activities designed, typically by a teacher, for the sole purpose of effectively improving specific aspects of an individual’s performance.

## The key ideas behind deliberate practice is that it:
- Pushes you just outside your comfort zone
- Repeated often
- Feedback on results in continuously available
- It's highly demanding mentally
- It's difficult
- It requires good goals

## As what Carol Dweck said
"the idea that we can grow our brain's capacity to learn and to solve problems
Not Yet (Are you not smart enough to solve it … or have you just not solved it yet?)"

## As what Angela said GRIT is the best way to success

## Alain de Botton  examines our ideas of success and failure -- and questions the assumptions underlying these two judgments. Is success always earned? Is failure? He makes an eloquent, witty case to move beyond snobbery to find true pleasure in our work.
