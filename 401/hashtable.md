### HASH table
A hash table is an implementation of an associative array, a list of key-value pairs that allow you to retrieve a value via a key. 

####  two main ways to implement a hash table
1-Using the Object Data Type

2-Using a Map Object

### Hashing : In a hash table, a new index is processed using the keys. And, the element corresponding to that key is stored in the index.
### Hash Collision :When the hash function generates the same index for multiple keys, there will be a conflict (what value to be stored in that index). This is called a hash collision.
