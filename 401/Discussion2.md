 ### 1-What's the difference between SQL  and NoSQL?

 <table>
    <tr>
        <td>SQL</td>
        <td>No SQL</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>called rational database
        </td>
        <td>called non-rational database</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>table based database</td>
        <td>document based</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>predefined schema</td>
        <td>dynamic schema for unstructured data</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>vertically scalable </td>
        <td>horizontally scalable</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>uses SQL ( structured query language ) for defining and manipulating the data, which is very powerful. </td>
        <td>queries are focused on collection of documents.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td> examples: MySql, Oracle, Sqlite, Postgres and MS-SQL</td>
        <td>examples: MongoDB, BigTable, Redis, RavenDb, Cassandra, Hbase, Neo4j and CouchDb</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td> SQL databases are good fit for the complex query intensive environment</td>
        <td> not good fit for complex queries</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td> not best fit for hierarchical data storage</td>
        <td> fits better for the hierarchical data storage as it follows the key-value pair way of storing data similar to JSON data.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td> best fit for heavy duty transactional type applications</td>
        <td> transactions purpose, it is still not comparable and sable enough in high load and for complex transactional applications</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Excellent support are available for all SQL database from their vendors</td>
        <td> some NoSQL database you still have to rely on community support</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td> emphasizes on ACID properties ( Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation and Durability)</td>
        <td> follows the Brewers CAP theorem ( Consistency, Availability and Partition tolerance)</td>
    </tr>

### 2- What is Sequelize and how to use it with Node js? 
Sequelize is a Node. js-based Object Relational Mapper that makes it easy to work with MySQL, MariaDB, SQLite, PostgreSQL databases, and more. An Object Relational Mapper performs functions like handling database records by representing the data as objects.


### 3- What is an ORM, how does it work, and how should I use one?
An object-relational mapper provides an object-oriented layer between relational databases and object-oriented programming languages without having to write SQL queries. It standardizes interfaces reducing boilerplate and speeding development time.


## Terms:

 ***SQL : is a standardized programming language that is used to manage relational databases and perform various operations on the data in them.***

 ***NOAQL : is an approach to database design that enables the storage and querying of data outside the traditional structures found in relational databases***
 
 ***database schema : is the structure of a database described in a formal language supported by the database management system (DBMS).***
 
 ***WRRC : web request response cycle***
